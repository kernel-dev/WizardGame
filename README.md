# Wizard Game simulation

A small-scale duelist-esque game simulation done in JS.

## Improvements TODO

- Base instance for weapons called `Weapon`
- `WeaponManager` singleton for managing weapons, assigning them to heroes/monsters, and managing their lifetime
- `EntityManager` singleton for managing entities (heroes/monsters), and managing their lifetime
- `DuelManager` singleton for managing brawls/duels
